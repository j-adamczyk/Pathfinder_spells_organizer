# Pathfinder Spell Organizer
Pen&Paper Role Playing Games (a. k. a. traditional RPGs) are my passion, especially the Pathfinder. 
It's also known as Mathfinder for the amount of math and calculations required to play it. 
The game contains staggering amount of spells for mage characters, so players often resort to applications to help them filter them. 
This app is my take on helping players play their mages - it offerts simple GUI, multiple filters to select only needed spells and, 
probably the most unique feature, it contains web crawler to search free online resources to stay updated on newest spells and game 
additions. This project was created for Software Mansion hackathon in collaboration with Magdalena Kozub and Natalia Organek, my studies 
colleagues. It's not finished yet, but will be! For newest updates, see their respective branches.
